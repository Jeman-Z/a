This code defines a custom PyTorch dataset for movie reviews, loads the data from CSV files, and efficiently batch processes and shuffles the data using a DataLoader. It helps to organize movie review data (e.g., titles, reviews, ratings) into structured batches for tasks such as machine learning model training or data analytics.The DataLoader improves processing efficiency by batching the data and leveraging parallelism to make iterating over large datasets easier.
